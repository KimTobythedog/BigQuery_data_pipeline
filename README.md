# ðŸš€ Google Cloud Data Pipeline (Cloned Project)  

This repository contains **cloned code** and configuration files for a **Google Cloud Data Engineering project**. The goal of this project is to **explore and understand** how **data pipelines** are built using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose of This Repository  
Since I am **new to data pipelines**, I cloned this project to **study its structure, experiment with its functionality, and gain hands-on experience** with cloud-based data pipelines. Itâ€™s a learning exercise rather than a production-ready system.

## ðŸ”§ What This Project Demonstrates  
âœ… **Uploading sales data** through a Flask web app.  
âœ… **Storing files** in a **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket**.  
âœ… **Triggering a Cloud Function** to process the data.  
âœ… **Loading structured data** into **BigQuery**.  
âœ… **Visualizing insights** with **Looker Studio**.
